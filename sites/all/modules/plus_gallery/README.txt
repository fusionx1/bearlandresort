Plus Gallery is a module that allows you to re-use your online photo albums.
This is done by integrating +Gallery, a responsive photo gallery created from
existing images or albums on Facebook, Google+, Flickr and Instagram.


REQUIREMENTS
------------	
* Libraries (http://drupal.org/project/libraries)


INSTALLATION
------------
* Install as usual, see http://drupal.org/node/70151 for further information.

* Go to http://plusgallery.net and download the latest version. Then uncompress
  the downloaded file to sites/all/libraries, and rename the folder so you get
  the following path sites/all/libraries/plusgallery.


NOTES
-----
* The images and albums being used have to be placed public, else it won't
  work! At this time you should only add 1 instance of this field per page.
  So only allow one value in the field settings.

* The integration of Facebook albums is only possible for pages!

* If you want to use Flickr you need an API key, you can request one here:
